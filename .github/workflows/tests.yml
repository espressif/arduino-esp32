# This file is used to run the runtime tests for the Arduino core for ESP32.
# The tests are run on the hardware, Wokwi and QEMU emulators.
# The QEMU tests are disabled for now as they are redundant with most of the Wokwi tests.
# As the Wokwi tests require access to secrets, they are run in a separate workflow.
# We need to ensure that the artifacts from previous tests in the chain are propagated for publishing the results.
# This is the current trigger sequence for the tests:
#  tests.yml -> tests_hw_wokwi.yml -> tests_results.yml
#   ⌙> tests_build.yml
#   ⌙> tests_qemu.yml
