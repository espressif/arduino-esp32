Introduction
------------

This is a basic introduction to how the peripherals work in the ESP32. This tutorial can be used to understand
how to define the peripheral usage and its corresponding pins.

In some microcontrollers' architecture, the peripherals are attached to specific pins and cannot be redefined to another one.

For example:

The *XYZ* MCU defines that the I2C peripheral SDA signal is the IO5 on the physical pin 10 and the SCL is on the IO6 and physical pin 11.

This means that, in your hardware project, you **NEED** to use these pins as the I2C and this cannot be changed due to the internal architecture.
In this case, you must be very careful during the hardware design to not make any mistake by switching the SDA and SCL connections. Firmware will not help you if you do so.

GPIO Matrix and Pin Mux
-----------------------

The ESP32 architecture includes the capability of configuring some peripherals to any of the GPIOs pins, managed by the `IO MUX GPIO`_.
Essentially, this capability means that we can route the internal peripheral into a different physical pin using the IO MUX and the GPIO Matrix.

.. figure:: ../../_static/tutorials/peripherals/tutorial_peripheral_diagram.png
    :align: center
    :width: 600
    :figclass: align-center

It means that in the scenario of the *XYZ* MCU, in the ESP32 we can use any of the GPIOs to route the SDA (input/output) and the SCL (output).

To use this functionality, we must be aware of some precautions:

* Some of the GPIOs are **INPUT** only.
* Some peripherals have output signals and must be used on GPIO's capable to be configured as **OUTPUT**.
* Some peripherals, mostly the high speed ones, ADC, DAC, Touch, and JTAG use dedicated GPIOs pins.
* Some pins are used to connect flash memory on the module - this prevents them from any other use - if a peripheral is routed to one of these pins the device will not be able to boot.

.. warning::
    Before assigning the peripheral pins in your design, double check if the pins you're using are appropriate.
    The input-only pins cannot be used for peripherals that require output or input/output signals.

The greatest advantage of this functionality is the fact that we don't need to be fully dependent on the physical pin, since we can change according to our needs.
This can facilitate the hardware design routing or in some cases, fix some pin swap mistake during the hardware design phase.

Here is the basic peripherals list present on the `ESP32`_. The peripheral list may vary from each ESP32 SoC family.

Usage Examples
--------------

In the Arduino Uno, we have the I2C pins defined by hardware, A4 is the SDA and A5 the SCL. In this case, we do not need to set
these pins in the ``Wire.begin();`` function, because they are already into the Wire library.

.. code-block:: arduino

    void setup()
    {
        Wire.begin(); // join i2c bus (address optional for master)
    }

Now, for the ESP32, the default pins for the I2C are SDA (GPIO21) and SCL (GPIO22). We can use a different pin as alternative for the
default ones if you need to change the pins.
To change the pins, we must call the ``Wire.setPins(int sda, int scl);`` function before calling ``Wire.begin();``.

.. code-block:: arduino

    int sda_pin = 16; // GPIO16 as I2C SDA
    int scl_pin = 17; // GPIO17 as I2C SCL

    void setup()
    {
        Wire.setPins(sda_pin, scl_pin); // Set the I2C pins before begin
        Wire.begin(); // join i2c bus (address optional for master)
    }

A similar approach also applies for the other peripherals.
