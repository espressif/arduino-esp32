About
-----
The LED control (LEDC) peripheral is primarily designed to control the intensity of LEDs,
although it can also be used to generate PWM signals for other purposes.

ESP32 SoCs has from 6 to 16 channels (variates on socs, see table below) which can generate independent waveforms, that can be used for example to drive RGB LED devices.

========= =======================
ESP32 SoC Number of LEDC channels
========= =======================
ESP32     16
ESP32-S2  8
ESP32-S3  8
ESP32-C3  6
ESP32-C6  6
