About Arduino ESP32
-------------------

Welcome to the Arduino ESP32 support documentation! Here you will find important information on how to use the project.

First Things First
------------------

.. note::
    Before continuing, we must be clear that this project is supported by `Espressif Systems`_ and the community.
    Everyone is more than welcome to contribute back to this project.

ESP32 is a single 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi-and-Bluetooth SoC (System On a Chip) designed by `Espressif Systems`_.

ESP32 is designed for mobile, wearable electronics, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. It features all the state-of-the-art characteristics
of low-power chips, including fine-grained clock gating, multiple power modes,and dynamic power scaling. For instance, in a low-power IoT sensor
hub application scenario, ESP32 is woken-up periodically and only when a specified condition is detected. Low-duty cycle is used to minimize the
amount of energy that the chip expends.

The output of the power amplifier is also adjustable, thus contributing to an optimal trade-off between communication range, data rate and
power consumption.

The ESP32 series is available as a chip or module.

Supported SoC's
---------------

Here are the ESP32 series supported by the Arduino-ESP32 project:

======== ====== =========== ===================================
SoC      Stable Development Datasheet
======== ====== =========== ===================================
ESP32    Yes    Yes         `ESP32`_
ESP32-S2 Yes    Yes         `ESP32-S2`_
ESP32-C3 Yes    Yes         `ESP32-C3`_
ESP32-S3 Yes    Yes         `ESP32-S3`_
ESP32-C6 No     Yes         `ESP32-C6`_
ESP32-H2 No     Yes         `ESP32-H2`_
======== ====== =========== ===================================

.. note::
    ESP32-C2 is also supported by Arduino-ESP32 but requires rebuilding the static libraries.
    This is not trivial and requires a good understanding of the ESP-IDF build system.
    For more information, see the `Lib Builder documentation <lib_builder.html>`_.

See `Boards <boards/boards.html>`_ for more details about ESP32 development boards.

Arduino Core Reference
----------------------

This documentation is built on the ESP32 and we are not going to cover the common Arduino API. To see the Arduino reference documentation,
please consider reading the official documentation.
