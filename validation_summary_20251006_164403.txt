2. PARTITION SCHEME SIZE ERRORS (Rule 3) - 2 boards:
   - esp32wrover: default_8MB (8MB) exceeds 4MB flash
   - pico32: custom upload size (16MB) exceeds 4MB flash

3. DUPLICATE LINES (Rule 6) - 4 boards:
   - esp32s3-octal: duplicate esp32s3-octal.menu.FlashSize.16M
   - lolin_s2_mini: duplicate lolin_s2_mini.build.defines

4. MISSING REQUIRED PROPERTIES (Rule 2) - 2 boards:
   - Bee_Data_Logger: Missing upload.flags, upload.extra_flags
   - Bee_Motion_S3: Missing upload.flags, upload.extra_flags

=== SUMMARY ===
- 37 boards have invalid build.board format (contains lowercase letters, hyphens, or special characters)
- 2 boards have partition schemes that exceed their available flash memory
- 4 boards have duplicate property definitions
- 2 boards are missing required upload properties
- Most common issue: build.board values contain lowercase letters instead of uppercase

=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===
1. Fix build.board values to use only uppercase letters, numbers, and underscores
2. Remove or adjust partition schemes that don't fit the board's flash capacity
3. Remove duplicate entries from boards.txt
4. Add missing upload properties for affected boards
