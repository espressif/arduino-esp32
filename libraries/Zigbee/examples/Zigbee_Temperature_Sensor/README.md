# Arduino-ESP32 Zigbee Temperature Sensor Example

This example shows how to configure the Zigbee end device and use it as a Home Automation (HA) temperature sensor.

# Supported Targets

Currently, this example supports the following targets.

| Supported Targets | ESP32-C6 | ESP32-H2 |
| ----------------- | -------- | -------- |

## Temperature Sensor Functions

Note:
 * This board means the board (e.g. ESP32-H2 / C6) loaded with `Zigbee_Temperature_Sensor` example.
 * The remote board means the board (e.g. ESP32-H2 / C6) loaded with `Zigbee_Thermostat` example.

Functions:
 * After this board first starts up, it would be configured locally to report the temperature on 1 degree change and no periodic reporting to the remote board.
 * By clicking the button (BOOT) on this board, this board will immediately send a report of the current measured temperature to the remote board.

## Hardware Required

* One development board (ESP32-H2 or ESP32-C6) acting as Zigbee coordinator (loaded with `Zigbee_Thermostat` example)
* A USB cable for power supply and programming
* Choose another board (ESP32-H2 or ESP32-C6) as Zigbee end device and upload the `Zigbee_Temperature_Sensor` example

### Configure the Project

In this example, the internal temperature sensor task is reading the chip temperature.
Set the Button GPIO by changing the `BUTTON_PIN` definition. By default, it's the pin `9` (BOOT button on ESP32-C6 and ESP32-H2).

#### Using Arduino IDE

To get more information about the Espressif boards see [Espressif Development Kits](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits).

* Before Compile/Verify, select the correct board: `Tools -> Board`.
* Select the End device Zigbee mode: `Tools -> Zigbee mode: Zigbee ED (end device)`
* Select Partition Scheme for Zigbee: `Tools -> Partition Scheme: Zigbee 4MB with spiffs`
* Select the COM port: `Tools -> Port: xxx` where the `xxx` is the detected COM port.
* Optional: Set debug level to verbose to see all logs from Zigbee stack: `Tools -> Core Debug Level: Verbose`.

## Troubleshooting

If the End device flashed with this example is not connecting to the coordinator, erase the flash of the End device before flashing the example to the board. It is recommended to do this if you re-flash the coordinator.
You can do the following:

* In the Arduino IDE go to the Tools menu and set `Erase All Flash Before Sketch Upload` to `Enabled`.
* Add to the sketch `Zigbee.factoryReset();` to reset the device and Zigbee stack.

By default, the coordinator network is closed after rebooting or flashing new firmware.
To open the network you have 2 options:

* Open network after reboot by setting `Zigbee.setRebootOpenNetwork(time);` before calling `Zigbee.begin();`.
* In application you can anytime call `Zigbee.openNetwork(time);` to open the network for devices to join.

***Important: Make sure you are using a good quality USB cable and that you have a reliable power source***

* **LED not blinking:** Check the wiring connection and the IO selection.
* **Programming Fail:** If the programming/flash procedure fails, try reducing the serial connection speed.
* **COM port not detected:** Check the USB cable and the USB to Serial driver installation.

If the error persists, you can ask for help at the official [ESP32 forum](https://esp32.com) or see [Contribute](#contribute).
