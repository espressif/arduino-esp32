# Arduino-ESP32 Zigbee Fan Control Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Zigbee library to create a router device fan control and use it as a Home Automation (HA) fan control device.

# Supported Targets

Currently, this example supports the following targets.

| Supported Targets | ESP32-C6 | ESP32-H2 |
| ----------------- | -------- | -------- |

## Fan Control Functions

1. Initialize a Zigbee fan control device.
2. Control fan modes (OFF, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, ON).
3. Respond to fan control commands from the Zigbee network.

## Hardware Required

* ESP32-H2 or ESP32-C6 development board
* A USB cable for power supply and programming
* RGB LED for visual feedback (built-in on most development boards)

### Configure the Project

In this example the RGB LED is used to indicate the current fan control mode.
The LED colors represent different fan modes:
- OFF: No light
- LOW: Blue
- MEDIUM: Yellow  
- HIGH: Red
- ON: White

Set the button GPIO by changing the `button` variable. By default, it's the pin `BOOT_PIN` (BOOT button on ESP32-C6 and ESP32-H2).

#### Using Arduino IDE

To get more information about the Espressif boards see [Espressif Development Kits](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits).

* Before Compile/Verify, select the correct board: `Tools -> Board`.
* Select the End device Zigbee mode: `Tools -> Zigbee mode: Zigbee ZCZR (coordinator/router)`
* Select Partition Scheme for Zigbee: `Tools -> Partition Scheme: Zigbee ZCZR 4MB with spiffs`
* Select the COM port: `Tools -> Port: xxx` where the `xxx` is the detected COM port.
* Optional: Set debug level to verbose to see all logs from Zigbee stack: `Tools -> Core Debug Level: Verbose`.

## Troubleshooting

If the End device flashed with this example is not connecting to the coordinator, erase the flash of the End device before flashing the example to the board. It is recommended to do this if you re-flash the coordinator.
You can do the following:

* In the Arduino IDE go to the Tools menu and set `Erase All Flash Before Sketch Upload` to `Enabled`.
* Add to the sketch `Zigbee.factoryReset();` to reset the device and Zigbee stack.

By default, the coordinator network is closed after rebooting or flashing new firmware.
To open the network you have 2 options:

* Open network after reboot by setting `Zigbee.setRebootOpenNetwork(time);` before calling `Zigbee.begin();`.
* In application you can anytime call `Zigbee.openNetwork(time);` to open the network for devices to join.


***Important: Make sure you are using a good quality USB cable and that you have a reliable power source***

* **LED not blinking:** Check the wiring connection and the IO selection.
* **Programming Fail:** If the programming/flash procedure fails, try reducing the serial connection speed.
* **COM port not detected:** Check the USB cable and the USB to Serial driver installation.

If the error persists, you can ask for help at the official [ESP32 forum](https://esp32.com) or see [Contribute](#contribute).
