  This example creates 6 on-off light endpoints that share the same onChangeOnOff() callback code.
  It uses Lambda Function with an extra Lambda Capture information that links the Endpoint to its individual information.
  After the Matter example is commissioned, the expected Serial output shall be similar to this:

Matter App Control: 'Room 1' (OnOffLight[0], Endpoint 1, GPIO 2) changed to: OFF
Matter App Control: 'Room 1' (OnOffLight[0], Endpoint 1, GPIO 2) changed to: ON
Matter App Control: 'Room 5' (OnOffLight[4], Endpoint 5, GPIO 10) changed to: ON
Matter App Control: 'Room 2' (OnOffLight[1], Endpoint 2, GPIO 4) changed to: ON
Matter App Control: 'Room 4' (OnOffLight[3], Endpoint 4, GPIO 8) changed to: ON
Matter App Control: 'Room 6' (OnOffLight[5], Endpoint 6, GPIO 12) changed to: ON
Matter App Control: 'Room 3' (OnOffLight[2], Endpoint 3, GPIO 6) changed to: ON
Matter App Control: 'Room 5' (OnOffLight[4], Endpoint 5, GPIO 10) changed to: OFF
