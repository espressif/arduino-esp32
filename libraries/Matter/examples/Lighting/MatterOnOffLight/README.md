# Matter On/Off Light Example

This example demonstrates how to create a Matter-compatible on/off light device using an ESP32 SoC microcontroller.\
The application showcases Matter commissioning, device control via smart home ecosystems, and manual control using a physical button with state persistence.

## Supported Targets

| SoC      | This sketch            | CHIPoBLE | Also in prebuild       | LED      |
| -------- | ---------------------- | -------- | ---------------------- | -------- |
| ESP32    | Wi-Fi (SSID in sketch) | Off      | Ethernet (EMAC or SPI) | Required |
| ESP32-S2 | Wi-Fi (SSID in sketch) | Off      | Ethernet (SPI)         | Required |
| ESP32-S3 | Wi-Fi (hub)            | On       | Ethernet (SPI)         | Required |
| ESP32-C3 | Wi-Fi (hub)            | On       | Ethernet (SPI)         | Required |
| ESP32-C5 | Wi-Fi (hub)            | On       | Ethernet (SPI)         | Required |
| ESP32-C6 | Wi-Fi (hub, default)   | On       | Thread, Ethernet (SPI) | Required |
| ESP32-H2 | Thread (hub)           | On       | Ethernet (SPI)         | Required |

### Note on Commissioning

This table is what **this sketch** does. It does not call `Matter.selectNetwork()` or start Ethernet.

- **ESP32 / ESP32-S2:** no CHIPoBLE in the Arduino IDE prebuild. The sketch calls `WiFi.begin(ssid, password)`.
- **ESP32-C6:** prebuild is dual-stack. Without `selectNetwork()` this sketch uses **Wi-Fi + CHIPoBLE**. Thread stays unused.
- **ESP32-H2:** Thread + CHIPoBLE (no Wi-Fi).
- **ESP32-C5:** Wi-Fi + CHIPoBLE. Thread is not in that prebuild.

To change the path, call `Matter.selectNetwork()` **before** any accessory `begin()`. On-network: `selectNetwork(net, true)` (CHIPoBLE off). CHIPoBLE: `selectNetwork(net)` (BLE stays on). Do not also call `setBLECommissioningEnabled()`.

- Wi-Fi + CHIPoBLE: [MatterCHIPoBLEWiFi](../../Commissioning/MatterCHIPoBLEWiFi)
- Wi-Fi on-network (CHIPoBLE off): [MatterOnNetworkWiFi](../../Commissioning/MatterOnNetworkWiFi)
- Thread + CHIPoBLE (C6/H2): [MatterCHIPoBLEThread](../../Commissioning/MatterCHIPoBLEThread)
- Thread on-network (C6/H2): [MatterOnNetworkThread](../../Commissioning/MatterOnNetworkThread)
- Ethernet (CHIPoBLE off): [MatterOnNetworkEthernet](../../Commissioning/MatterOnNetworkEthernet)

## Features

- Matter protocol implementation for an on/off light device
- Default network and CHIPoBLE as in the Supported Targets table (C6 dual-stack uses Wi-Fi unless you call `selectNetwork()`)
- Simple on/off control
- State persistence using `Preferences` library
- Button control for toggling light and factory reset
- Matter commissioning via QR code or manual pairing code
- Integration with Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, and Google Home

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 compatible development board (see supported targets table)
- LED connected to GPIO pin (or using built-in LED) for visual feedback
- User button for manual control (uses BOOT button by default)

## Pin Configuration

- **LED**: Uses `LED_BUILTIN` if defined, otherwise pin 2
- **Button**: Uses `BOOT_PIN` by default

## Software Setup

### Prerequisites

1. Install the Arduino IDE (2.0 or newer recommended)
2. Install ESP32 Arduino Core with Matter support
3. ESP32 Arduino libraries:
   - `Matter`
   - `Preferences`
   - `WiFi` (only for ESP32 and ESP32-S2)

### Configuration

Before uploading the sketch, configure the following:

1. **Wi-Fi credentials** (if not using BLE commissioning - mandatory for ESP32 | ESP32-S2):
   ```cpp
   const char *ssid = "your-ssid";         // Change to your Wi-Fi SSID
   const char *password = "your-password"; // Change to your Wi-Fi password
   ```

2. **LED pin configuration** (if not using built-in LED):
   ```cpp
   const uint8_t ledPin = 2;  // Set your LED pin here
   ```

3. **Button pin configuration** (optional):
   By default, the `BOOT` button (GPIO 0) is used for the Light On/Off manual control and factory reset. You can change this to a different pin if needed.
   ```cpp
   const uint8_t buttonPin = BOOT_PIN;  // Set your button pin here
   ```

## Building and Flashing

1. Open the `MatterOnOffLight.ino` sketch in the Arduino IDE.
2. Select your ESP32 board from the **Tools > Board** menu.
<!-- vale off -->
3. Select **"Huge APP (3MB No OTA/1MB SPIFFS)"** from **Tools > Partition Scheme** menu.
<!-- vale on -->
4. Enable **"Erase All Flash Before Sketch Upload"** option from **Tools** menu.
5. Connect your ESP32 board to your computer via USB.
6. Click the **Upload** button to compile and flash the sketch.

## Expected Output

Once the sketch is running, open the Serial Monitor at a baud rate of **115200**. Wi-Fi connection messages appear only on ESP32 and ESP32-S2. CHIPoBLE targets get the operational network from the hub (Wi-Fi, or Thread on ESP32-H2). You should see output similar to the following, which provides the necessary information for commissioning:

```
Connecting to your-wifi-ssid
.......

```

## Using the Device

### Manual Control

The user button (BOOT button by default) provides manual control:

- **Short press of the button**: Toggle light on/off
- **Long press (>5 seconds)**: Factory reset the device (decommission)

### State Persistence

The device saves the last known on/off state using the `Preferences` library. After a power cycle or restart:

- The device will restore to the last saved state (ON or OFF)
- The Matter controller will be notified of the restored state
- The LED will reflect the restored state

### Smart Home Integration

Use a Matter-compatible hub (like an Apple HomePod, Google Nest Hub, or Amazon Echo) to commission the device.

#### Apple Home

1. Open the Home app on your iOS device
2. Tap the "+" button > Add Accessory
3. Scan the QR code displayed in the Serial Monitor, or
4. Tap "I Don't Have a Code or Cannot Scan" and enter the manual pairing code
5. Follow the prompts to complete setup
6. The device will appear as an on/off light in your Home app

#### Amazon Alexa

1. Open the Alexa app
2. Tap More > Add Device > Matter
3. Select "Scan QR code" or "Enter code manually"
4. Complete the setup process
5. The light will appear in your Alexa app
6. You can control it using voice commands like "Alexa, turn on the light" or "Alexa, turn off the light"

#### Google Home

1. Open the Google Home app
2. Tap "+" > Set up device > New device
3. Choose "Matter device"
4. Scan the QR code or enter the manual pairing code
5. Follow the prompts to complete setup
6. You can control it using voice commands or the app controls

## Code Structure

The MatterOnOffLight example consists of the following main components:

1. **`setup()`**: Initializes hardware (button, LED), configures Wi-Fi (if needed), initializes `Preferences` library, sets up the Matter endpoint with the last saved state (defaults to ON if not previously saved), registers the callback function, and starts the Matter stack.

2. **`loop()`**: Checks the Matter commissioning state, handles button input for toggling the light and factory reset, and allows the Matter stack to process events.

3. **Callbacks**:
   - `setLightOnOff()`: Controls the physical LED based on the on/off state, saves the state to `Preferences` for persistence, and prints the state change to Serial Monitor.

## Troubleshooting

- **Device not visible during commissioning**: Ensure Wi-Fi or Thread connectivity is properly configured
- **LED not responding**: Verify pin configurations and connections
- **State not persisting**: Check that the `Preferences` library is properly initialized and that flash memory is not corrupted
- **Failed to commission**: Try factory resetting the device by long-pressing the button. Other option would be to erase the SoC Flash Memory by using `Arduino IDE Menu` -> `Tools` -> `Erase All Flash Before Sketch Upload: "Enabled"` or directly with `esptool.py --port <PORT> erase_flash`
- **Button not toggling light**: Ensure the button is properly connected and the debounce time is appropriate. Check Serial Monitor for "User button released" messages
- **No serial output**: Check baudrate (115200) and USB connection
