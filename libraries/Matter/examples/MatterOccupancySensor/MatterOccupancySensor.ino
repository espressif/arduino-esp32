/*
 * This example is an example code that will create a Matter Device which can be
 * commissioned and controlled from a Matter Environment APP.
 * Additionally the ESP32 will send debug messages indicating the Matter activity.
 * Turning DEBUG Level ON may be useful to following Matter Accessory and Controller messages.
 *
 * The example will create a Matter Occupancy Sensor Device.
 * The Occupancy Sensor will be simulated to change its state every 2 minutes.
 *
 * The onboard button can be kept pressed for 5 seconds to decommission the Matter Node.
 * The example will also show the manual commissioning code and QR code to be used in the Matter environment.
