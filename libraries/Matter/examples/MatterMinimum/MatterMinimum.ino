 * This example is the smallest code that will create a Matter Device which can be
 * commissioned and controlled from a Matter Environment APP.
 * It controls a GPIO that could be attached to a LED for visualization.
 * Additionally the ESP32 will send debug messages indicating the Matter activity.
 * Turning DEBUG Level ON may be useful to following Matter Accessory and Controller messages.
