WiFi automatic LightSleep
=====================================
This code displays how to use automatic light sleep with an active WiFi connection
and tune WiFi modem sleep modes

Hardware Connections (optional)
======================
Use an ammeter/scope connected in series with a CPU/DevKit board to measure power consumption

    // CPU will automatically go into light sleep if no ongoing activity (active task, peripheral activity etc.)
    setAutomaticLightSleep(true);

    WiFi.begin(wifi_ssid, wifi_password);

    // Additionally to automatic CPU sleep a modem can also be setup for a power saving.
    // If a WiFi is active - selected modem sleep mode will determine how much CPU will be sleeping.
    // There are two functions available:setSleep(mode) and setSleep(mode, listenInterval)
    // mode - supports one of three values:
    //     * WIFI_PS_NONE - No power save
    //     * WIFI_PS_MIN_MODEM - Minimum modem power saving. In this mode, station wakes up to receive beacon every DTIM period
    //     * WIFI_PS_MAX_MODEM - Maximum modem power saving. In this mode, interval to receive beacons is determined by the listenInterval parameter
    // listenInterval - effective only with a WIFI_PS_MAX_MODEM mode. determines how often will modem (and consequently CPU) wakeup to catch WiFi beacon packets.
    //     The larger the interval - the less power needed for WiFi connection support. However that comes at a cost of increased networking latency, i.e.
    //     If your device responds to some external requests (web-server, ping etc.) - larger listenInterval means device takes more to respond.
    //     Reasonable range is 2..9, going larger would not benefit too much in terms of power consumption. Too large value might result in WiFi connection drop.
    //     listenInterval is measured in DTIM intervals, which is determined by your access point (typically ~100ms).
    WiFi.setSleep(WIFI_PS_MAX_MODEM, 4);

    // allows CPU to go into light sleep mode until there is some task to do.
