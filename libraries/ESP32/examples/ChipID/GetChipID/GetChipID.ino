/* The true ESP32 chip ID is essentially its MAC address.
This sketch provides an alternate chip ID that matches
the output of the ESP.getChipId() function on ESP8266
(i.e. a 32-bit integer matching the last 3 bytes of
the MAC address. This is less unique than the
MAC address chip ID, but is helpful when you need
an identifier that can be no more than a 32-bit integer
(like for switch...case).
