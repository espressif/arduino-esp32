/*
 *
 * This Sketch demonstrates the effect of changing RX FIFO Full parameter into HardwareSerial Class
 * Serial.setRxFIFOFull(byte) is used to change it.
 * By default, UART ISR will wait for 120 bytes to arrive into UART before making the data available
 * to be read by an Arduino Sketch. It may also release fewer bytes after an RX Timeout equivalent by
 * default to 2 UART symbols.
 *
 * The way we demonstrate the effect of this parameter is by measuring the time the Sketch takes
 * to read data using Arduino HardwareSerial API.
 *
 * The higher RX FIFO Full is, the lower consumption of the core to process and make the data available.
 * At the same time, it may take longer for the Sketch to be able to read it, because the data must first
 * populate RX UART FIFO.
 *
 * The lower RX FIFO Full is, the higher consumption of the core to process and make the data available.
 * This is because the core will be interrupted often and it will copy data from the RX FIFO to the Arduino
 * internal buffer to be read by the sketch. By other hand, the data will be made available to the sketch
 * faster, in a close to byte by byte communication.
 *
 * Therefore, it allows the decision of the architecture to be designed by the developer.
 * Some application based on certain protocols may need the sketch to read the Serial Port byte by byte, for example.
