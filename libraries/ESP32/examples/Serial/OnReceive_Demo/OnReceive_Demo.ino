   This Sketch demonstrates how to use onReceive(callbackFunc) with HardwareSerial

   void HardwareSerial::onReceive(OnReceiveCb function, bool onlyOnTimeout = false)

   It is possible to register a UART callback function that will be called
   every time that UART receives data and an associated interrupt is generated.

   The receiving data interrupt can occur because of two possible events:

   1- UART FIFO FULL: it happens when internal UART FIFO reaches a certain number of bytes.
      Its full capacity is 127 bytes. The FIFO Full threshold for the interrupt can be changed
      using HardwareSerial::setRxFIFOFull(uint8_t fifoFull).
      Default FIFO Full Threshold is set at the UART initialization using HardwareSerial::begin()
      This will depend on the baud rate set with when begin() is executed.
      For a baudrate of 115200 or lower, it it just 1 byte, mimicking original Arduino UART driver.
      For a baudrate over 115200 it will be 120 bytes for higher performance.
      Anyway it can be changed by the application at anytime.

   2- UART RX Timeout: it happens, based on a timeout equivalent to a number of symbols at
      the current baud rate. If the UART line is idle for this timeout, it will raise an interrupt.
      This time can be changed by HardwareSerial::setRxTimeout(uint8_t rxTimeout)

   When any of those two interrupts occur, IDF UART driver will copy FIFO data to its internal
   RingBuffer and then Arduino can read such data. At the same time, Arduino Layer will execute
   the callback function defined with HardwareSerial::onReceive().

   <bool onlyOnTimeout> parameter (default false) can be used by the application to tell Arduino to
   only execute the callback when the second event above happens (Rx Timeout). At this time all
   received data will be available to be read by the Arduino application. But if the number of
   received bytes is higher than the FIFO space, it will generate an error of FIFO overflow.
   In order to avoid such problem, the application shall set an appropriate RX buffer size using
   HardwareSerial::setRxBufferSize(size_t new_size) before executing begin() for the Serial port.

   In summary, HardwareSerial::onReceive() works like an RX Interrupt callback, that can be adjusted
   using HardwareSerial::setRxFIFOFull() and HardwareSerial::setRxTimeout().
