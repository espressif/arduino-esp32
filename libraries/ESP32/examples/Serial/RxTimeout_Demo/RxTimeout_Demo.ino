/*

   This Sketch demonstrates the effect of changing RX Timeout parameter into HardwareSerial Class
   Serial.setRxTimeout(byte) is used to change it.
   By default, UART ISR will wait for an RX Timeout equivalent to 2 UART symbols to understand that a flow.
   of UART data has ended. For example, if just one byte is received, UART will send about 10 to
   11 bits depending of the configuration (parity, number of stopbits). The timeout is measured in
   number of UART symbols, with 10 or 11 bits, in the current baudrate.
   For 9600 baud, 1 bit takes 1/9600 of a second, equivalent to 104 microseconds, therefore, for 10 bits,
   it takes about 1ms. A timeout of 2 UART symbols, with about 20 bits, would take about 2.1 milliseconds
   for the ESP32 UART to trigger an IRQ telling the UART driver that the transmission has ended.
   Just at this point, the data will be made available to Arduino HardwareSerial API (read(), available(), etc).

   The way we demonstrate the effect of this parameter is by measuring the time the Sketch takes
   to read data using Arduino HardwareSerial API.

   The higher RX Timeout is, the longer it will take to make the data available, when a flow of data ends.
   UART driver works copying data from UART FIFO to Arduino internal buffer.
   The driver will copy data from FIFO when RX Timeout is detected or when FIFO is full.
   ESP32 FIFO has 128 bytes and by default, the driver will copy the data when FIFO reaches 120 bytes.
   If UART receives less than 120 bytes, it will wait RX Timeout to understand that the bus is IDLE and
   then copy the data from the FIFO to the Arduino internal buffer, making it available to the Arduino API.
