/*
  Deep Sleep with External Wake Up
  =====================================
  This code displays how to use deep sleep with
  an external trigger as a wake up source and how
  to store data in RTC memory to use it over reboots

  This code is under Public Domain License.

  Hardware Connections
  ======================
  Push Button to GPIO 33 pulled down with a 10K Ohm
  resistor

  NOTE:
  ======
  Only RTC IO can be used as a source for external wake
  source. They are pins: 0,2,4,12-15,25-27,32-39.

    to be on while ext1 uses RTC Controller so does not need

         increase some power comsumption. However, if we turn off the RTC_PERIPH domain or if certain chips lack the RTC_PERIPH
         domain, we will use the HOLD feature to maintain the pull-up and pull-down on the pins during sleep.
