/*
Simple Deep Sleep with Timer Wake Up
=====================================
ESP32 offers a deep sleep mode for effective power
saving as power is an important factor for IoT
applications. In this mode CPUs, most of the RAM,
and all the digital peripherals which are clocked
from APB_CLK are powered off. The only parts of
the chip which can still be powered on are:
RTC controller, RTC peripherals ,and RTC memories

This code displays the most basic deep sleep with
a timer to wake it up and how to store data in
RTC memory to use it over reboots
