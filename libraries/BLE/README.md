# ESP32 BLE for Arduino
The Arduino IDE provides an excellent library package manager where versions of libraries can be downloaded and installed. This Github project provides the repository for the ESP32 BLE support for Arduino.

The original source of the Bluedroid project, **which is not maintained anymore**, can be found here: https://github.com/nkolban/esp32-snippets

Some parts of the NimBLE implementation are based on the work of h2zero, which can be found here: https://github.com/h2zero/NimBLE-Arduino

Issues and questions should be raised here: https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/issues <br> (please don't use https://github.com/nkolban/esp32-snippets/issues or https://github.com/h2zero/NimBLE-Arduino/issues!)

Documentation for using the library can be found here: https://github.com/nkolban/esp32-snippets/tree/master/Documentation

For a more customizable and feature-rich implementation of the NimBLE stack, you can use the [NimBLE-Arduino](https://github.com/h2zero/NimBLE-Arduino) library.
