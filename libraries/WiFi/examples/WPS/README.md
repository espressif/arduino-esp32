Example Serial Logs For Various Cases
======================================

For WPS Push Button method,after the ESP32 boots up and prints that WPS has started, press the button that looks something like [this](https://www.verizon.com/supportresources/images/fqgrouter-frontview-wps-button.png) on your router. In case you dont find anything similar, check your router specs if it does really support WPS Push functionality.

As for WPS Pin Mode, it will output a 8 digit Pin on the Serial Monitor that will change every 2 minutes if it hasn't connected. You need to log in to your router (generally reaching 192.168.0.1) and enter the pin shown in Serial Monitor in the WPS Settings of your router.
