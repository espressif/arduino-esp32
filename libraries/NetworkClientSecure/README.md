NetworkClientSecure
================

The NetworkClientSecure class implements support for secure connections using TLS (SSL).
It inherits from NetworkClient and thus implements a superset of that class' interface.
There are three ways to establish a secure connection using the NetworkClientSecure class:
using a root certificate authority (CA) cert, using a root CA cert plus a client cert and key,
and using a pre-shared key (PSK).

Using a root certificate authority cert
---------------------------------------
This method authenticates the server and negotiates an encrypted connection.
It is the same functionality as implemented in your web browser when you connect to HTTPS sites.

If you are accessing your own server:
- Generate a root certificate for your own certificate authority
- Generate a cert & private key using your root certificate ("self-signed cert") for your server

If you are accessing a public server:
- Obtain the cert of the public CA that signed that server's cert
Then:
- In NetworkClientSecure use setCACert (or the appropriate connect method) to set the root cert of your
  CA or of the public CA
- When NetworkClientSecure connects to the target server it uses the CA cert to verify the certificate
  presented by the server, and then negotiates encryption for the connection

Please see the NetworkClientSecure example.

Using a bundle of root certificate authority certificates
---------------------------------------------------------
This method is similar to the single root certificate verification above, but it uses a standard set of
root certificates from Mozilla to authenticate against, while the previous method only accepts a single
certificate for a given server. This allows the client to connect to all public SSL servers.

To use this feature in PlatformIO:
1. create a certificate bundle as described in the document below, or obtain a pre-built one you trust:
https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/protocols/esp_crt_bundle.html
(gen_crt_bundle.py can be found in the /tools folder)
   a. note: the full bundle will take up around 64k of flash space, but has minimal RAM usage, as only
      the index of the certificates is kept in RAM
2. Place the bundle under the file name "data/cert/x509_crt_bundle.bin" in your platformio project
3. add "board_build.embed_files = data/cert/x509_crt_bundle.bin" in your platformio.ini
4. add the following global declaration in your project:
   extern const uint8_t rootca_crt_bundle_start[] asm("_binary_data_cert_x509_crt_bundle_bin_start");
5. before initiating the first SSL connection, call
   my_client.setCACertBundle(rootca_crt_bundle_start);

To use this feature in Arduino IDE:
If the Arduino IDE added support for embedding files in the meantime, then follow the instructions above.
If not, you have three choices:
1. convert your project to PlatformIO
2. create a makefile where you can add the idf_component_register() declaration to include the certificate bundle
3. Store the bundle as a SPIFFS file, but then you have to load it into RAM in runtime and waste 64k of precious memory

Using a root CA cert and client cert/keys
-----------------------------------------
This method authenticates the server and additionally also authenticates
the client to the server, then negotiates an encrypted connection.

- Follow steps above
- Using your root CA generate cert/key for your client
- Register the keys with the server you will be accessing so the server can authenticate your client
- In NetworkClientSecure use setCACert (or the appropriate connect method) to set the root cert of your
  CA or of the public CA, this is used to authenticate the server
- In NetworkClientSecure use setCertificate, and setPrivateKey (or the appropriate connect method) to
  set your client's cert & key, this will be used to authenticate your client to the server
- When NetworkClientSecure connects to the target server it uses the CA cert to verify the certificate
  presented by the server, it will use the cert/key to authenticate your client to the server, and
  it will then negotiate encryption for the connection

Using Pre-Shared Keys (PSK)
---------------------------

TLS supports authentication and encryption using a pre-shared key (i.e. a key that both client and
server know) as an alternative to the public key cryptography commonly used on the web for HTTPS.
PSK is starting to be used for MQTT, e.g. in mosquitto, to simplify the set-up and avoid having to
go through the whole CA, cert, and private key process.

A pre-shared key is a binary string of up to 32 bytes and is commonly represented in hex form. In
addition to the key, clients can also present an id and typically the server allows a different key
to be associated with each client id. In effect this is very similar to username and password pairs,
except that unlike a password the key is not directly transmitted to the server, thus a connection to a
malicious server does not divulge the password. Plus the server is also authenticated to the client.

To use PSK:
- Generate a random hex string (generating an MD5 or SHA for some file is one way to do this)
- Come up with a string id for your client and configure your server to accept the id/key pair
- In NetworkClientSecure use setPreSharedKey (or the appropriate connect method) to
  set the id/key combo
- When NetworkClientSecure connects to the target server it uses the id/key combo to authenticate the
  server (it must prove that it has the key too), authenticate the client and then negotiate
  encryption for the connection

Please see the NetworkClientPSK example.

Specifying the ALPN Protocol
----------------------------

Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) is a Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension that allows
the application layer to negotiate which protocol should be performed over a secure connection in a manner
that avoids additional round trips and which is independent of the application-layer protocols.

For example, this is used with AWS IoT Custom Authorizers where an MQTT client must set the ALPN protocol to ```mqtt```:

```
const char *aws_protos[] = {"mqtt", NULL};
...
wiFiClient.setAlpnProtocols(aws_protos);
```

Examples

#### NetworkClientInsecure
Demonstrates usage of insecure connection using `NetworkClientSecure::setInsecure()`
#### NetworkClientPSK

This is useful with MQTT servers instead of using a self-signed cert, tested with mosquitto.

#### NetworkClientSecure

Running on TLS 1.2 using mbedTLS
#### NetworkClientSecureEnterprise
This example demonstrates a secure connection to a WiFi network using WPA/WPA2 Enterprise (for example eduroam),
and establishing a secure HTTPS connection with an external server (for example arduino.php5.sk) using the defined anonymous identity, user identity, and password.

.. note::
  This example is outdated and might not work. For more examples see [https://github.com/martinius96/ESP32-eduroam](https://github.com/martinius96/ESP32-eduroam)

#### NetworkClientShowPeerCredentials
Example of a establishing a secure connection and then showing the fingerprint of the certificate.
This can be useful in an IoT setting to know for sure that you are connecting to the right server.
Especially in situations where you cannot hardcode a trusted root certificate for long
periods of time (as they tend to get replaced more often than the lifecycle of IoT hardware).
